# Finite-Element-Analysis-of-Concrete-using-Python

The Finite Element Analysis and Design of Concrete Structures Using Python
(FEACP)

## Objective

This repository is considered to be an educational resource for the theory and
of application of the Finite Element Analysis of Concrete Structures. The
finite element formulations are programmed using the Python language and
will cover frame and two-dimensional plate elements.

The structural engineering principles will be applied to reinforced concrete
structures and will cover elements that are designed to AS3600:2018.

Derivations for finite element formulations will be referenced.
